# SB2EnglishPatch
All the code used in creating the english patch for the ps2 version of Sengoku Basara 2

Original Start Date: 00/05/2020
Just started moving things to git today, trying to organize and clean things up a little

Currently there are two folders:

tools	:	For subroutines used for gathering pieces of information / finding addresses
src		:	The actual code used to test and view the translation via EMU
build	:	Will be used to convert the src code into an actual patch
